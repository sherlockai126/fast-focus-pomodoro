**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Decision Resolution  
**Purpose**: Resolve all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items from feature specification

---

## Research Tasks & Decisions

### 1. Authentication Method Resolution
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Authentication method not specified - email/password, existing app auth, SSO?

**Research**: Examined existing codebase structure and found:
- NextAuth.js already configured (`/src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Prisma User model exists with authentication setup
- Session management already implemented

**Decision**: Use existing NextAuth.js authentication system
**Rationale**: 
- Already implemented and working in the application
- Provides session management required for chat user identification
- Maintains consistency with existing user flows
**Alternatives considered**: Custom auth system, but would duplicate existing functionality

### 2. User Registration/Profile Requirements
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: User registration/profile requirements unclear

**Research**: Analyzed existing user system:
- User model already exists in Prisma schema
- Registration flow implemented via NextAuth
- User profiles contain necessary identification data

**Decision**: Extend existing user profiles with chat-specific fields (online status, last seen)
**Rationale**: 
- Leverages existing user management
- Minimal additional complexity
- Consistent with app architecture
**Alternatives considered**: Separate chat profiles, but would create data duplication

### 3. Message Persistence Requirements
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Message persistence requirements not specified

**Research**: Evaluated storage options and user expectations:
- Existing app uses PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Users expect conversation history persistence
- Regulatory requirements for data retention unclear

**Decision**: Store all messages in PostgreSQL with 30-day retention policy
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with existing data storage approach
- 30 days balances user needs with storage costs
- Enables search and conversation history features
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Redis for temporary storage: Rejected due to data loss risk
- Infinite retention: Rejected due to storage/privacy concerns

### 4. Real-time vs Asynchronous Messaging
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Real-time vs asynchronous messaging preference unclear

**Research**: Analyzed user expectations and technical feasibility:
- User story explicitly mentions "real-time messaging"
- Modern web chat expectations require instant delivery
- WebSocket technology mature and well-supported

**Decision**: Implement real-time messaging using Socket.io with fallback support
**Rationale**: 
- Meets explicit user requirement for real-time communication
- Socket.io provides reliable WebSocket implementation
- Fallback ensures functionality on limited networks
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Polling-based: Rejected due to performance and user experience issues
- Server-sent events: Rejected due to unidirectional limitation

### 5. Group Chat vs One-on-One Chat Scope
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Group chat vs one-on-one chat scope unclear

**Research**: Evaluated complexity and user needs:
- One-on-one chat simpler to implement and test
- Group chat adds significant complexity (permissions, notifications, member management)
- Can be added as future enhancement

**Decision**: Phase 1 implements one-on-one chat only, design for future group chat expansion
**Rationale**: 
- Reduces initial implementation complexity
- Faster time to market for core functionality
- Database schema can accommodate future group chat features
**Alternatives considered**: Full group chat implementation, but deemed too complex for initial release

### 6. Message Formatting/Media Support
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Message formatting/media support requirements unclear

**Research**: Analyzed implementation complexity vs user value:
- Text messaging provides core functionality
- Rich formatting adds significant complexity
- File/image sharing requires storage and security considerations

**Decision**: Phase 1 supports plain text messages with basic emoji support, URLs auto-linked
**Rationale**: 
- Minimal viable product approach
- Text messaging covers 80% of use cases
- Can add rich media as future enhancement
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Full rich text: Rejected due to complexity
- No formatting: Rejected due to poor user experience

### 7. Online/Offline Status Requirements
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: online/offline indicators required?

**Research**: Evaluated user experience benefits:
- Online status improves user engagement
- Simple to implement with WebSocket connections
- Standard feature in modern chat applications

**Decision**: Implement basic online/offline status with "last seen" timestamps
**Rationale**: 
- Enhances user experience significantly
- Low implementation complexity
- Enables features like typing indicators
**Alternatives considered**: No status tracking, but would degrade user experience

### 8. Content Restrictions/Filtering
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: content restrictions/filtering requirements?

**Research**: Analyzed security and moderation needs:
- Basic XSS protection essential for security
- Content moderation may be needed for business context
- Real-time filtering adds latency

**Decision**: Implement XSS sanitization and basic profanity filtering, with admin reporting
**Rationale**: 
- Security sanitization is non-negotiable
- Basic filtering prevents obvious inappropriate content
- Admin reporting allows human moderation
**Alternatives considered**: 
- No filtering: Rejected due to security risks
- Advanced AI moderation: Rejected due to complexity and cost

### 9. Notification System Requirements
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: notification system requirements unclear

**Research**: Evaluated notification options:
- Browser notifications available and effective
- Email notifications may be excessive for chat
- In-app notifications essential for user awareness

**Decision**: Implement browser notifications for new messages when tab is inactive, plus in-app notification badges
**Rationale**: 
- Non-intrusive but effective user alerts
- Respects user attention and choice
- Standard pattern for web applications
**Alternatives considered**: 
- No notifications: Poor user experience
- Email notifications: Too intrusive for chat messages

### 10. Message Search Functionality
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: message search functionality requirements unclear

**Research**: Evaluated search complexity and user value:
- Basic text search high value for users
- Full-text search indexing adds complexity
- PostgreSQL provides adequate search capabilities

**Decision**: Implement basic keyword search within conversations using PostgreSQL LIKE queries
**Rationale**: 
- High user value with moderate complexity
- Leverages existing database capabilities
- Can enhance with full-text search later
**Alternatives considered**: 
- No search: Poor user experience for long conversations
- Elasticsearch: Overkill for initial implementation

## Performance & Scalability Research

### Concurrent Connection Limits
- Socket.io can handle 100+ concurrent connections per Node.js process
- Horizontal scaling available via Redis adapter if needed
- Current scope (50-100 users) well within limits

### Database Query Optimization
- Proper indexing on message timestamps and conversation participants
- Pagination for message history (load 50 messages initially, load more on scroll)
- Efficient real-time queries using database subscriptions

### Caching Strategy
- Message caching in React state during active conversations
- No server-side caching initially (can add Redis if needed)
- Browser caching for user profiles and conversation metadata
