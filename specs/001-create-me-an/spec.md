# Feature Specification: Real-time Chat Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-me-an`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create me an chat application on webapp"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: "create me an chat application on webapp"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: chat users, webapp users
   ‚Üí Actions: sending messages, receiving messages, chatting
   ‚Üí Data: messages, conversations, user identity
   ‚Üí Constraints: webapp platform
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication method not specified]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User registration/profile requirements unclear]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Message persistence requirements not specified]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Real-time vs asynchronous messaging preference unclear]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Group chat vs one-on-one chat scope unclear]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Message formatting/media support requirements unclear]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary user flow: users send and receive messages in real-time
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement marked as testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Users, Messages, Conversations identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple clarification needs"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a webapp user, I want to communicate with other users through real-time messaging so that I can have conversations and exchange information instantly within the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I send a message to another user, **Then** the message appears in our conversation thread immediately
2. **Given** another user sends me a message, **When** the message is sent, **Then** I receive the message in real-time without refreshing the page
3. **Given** I have an active conversation, **When** I navigate away and return, **Then** I can see the complete conversation history
4. **Given** I am typing a message, **When** the other user is also online, **Then** they see a typing indicator
5. **Given** I want to start a new conversation, **When** I select a user to chat with, **Then** a new conversation thread is created

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to send an empty message?
- How does the system handle message delivery when a user is offline?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during message sending?
- How are conversations displayed when a user has hundreds of messages?
- What happens when multiple users try to message the same person simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to send text messages to other users
- **FR-002**: System MUST display messages in real-time without requiring page refresh
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain conversation history between users
- **FR-004**: System MUST show when users are actively typing a message
- **FR-005**: System MUST indicate message delivery status (sent, delivered, read)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display timestamp for each message
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to see a list of their conversations
- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, existing app auth, SSO?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle user presence status [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: online/offline indicators required?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: one-on-one only or group chat functionality?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate and sanitize message content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: content restrictions/filtering requirements?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST store message data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file/image sharing support requirements unclear]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: message search functionality requirements unclear]
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification system requirements unclear]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a person using the chat system, has identity and authentication status
- **Message**: Contains text content, timestamp, sender, delivery status, and conversation context
- **Conversation**: Represents a communication thread between users, contains message history and participants
- **Typing Indicator**: Temporary status showing when a user is actively composing a message
